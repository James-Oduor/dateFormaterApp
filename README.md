 # Learn the Date Object by Building a Date Formatter

A simple web application that demonstrates how to use the JavaScript `Date` object to dynamically display the current date in various formats.

## Features

- Displays the current date in the default format: **Day, Month, Year (dd-mm-yyyy)**.
- Allows users to select from three different date formats:
  1. **Day, Month, Year (dd-mm-yyyy)**
  2. **Year, Month, Day (yyyy-mm-dd)**
  3. **Month, Day, Year, Hours, Minutes (mm-dd-yyyy h:mm)**
- Fully responsive design for mobile devices.



## How It Works

The application uses:
- HTML to structure the content.
- CSS for styling, including a dark theme and responsive design.
- JavaScript to dynamically update the displayed date based on the user's selection.
